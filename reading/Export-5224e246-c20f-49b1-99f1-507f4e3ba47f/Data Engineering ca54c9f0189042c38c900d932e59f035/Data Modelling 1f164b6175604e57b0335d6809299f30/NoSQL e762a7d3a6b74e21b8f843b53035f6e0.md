# NoSQL

# When to use?

- large amounts of data
- horizontally scale
- high throughput — fast reads and writes!
- need a flexible schema (rows don't need all the same columns)
- high availability (no down time)
- store different data types and data formats
- users are distributed and we want low latency (geographically distributed)

### **When to use a NoSQL Database**

- **Need to be able to store different data type formats**: NoSQL was also created to handle different data configurations: structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. JSON, XML documents can all be handled easily with NoSQL.
- **Large amounts of data**: Relational Databases are not distributed databases and because of this they can only scale vertically by adding more storage in the machine itself. NoSQL databases were created to be able to be horizontally scalable. The more servers/systems you add to the database the more data that can be hosted with high availability and low latency (fast reads and writes).
- **Need horizontal scalability**: Horizontal scalability is the ability to add more machines or nodes to a system to increase performance and space for data
- **Need high throughput**: While ACID transactions bring benefits they also slow down the process of reading and writing data. If you need very fast reads and writes using a relational database may not suit your needs.
- **Need a flexible schema**: Flexible schema can allow for columns to be added that do not have to be used by every row, saving disk space.
- **Need high availability**: Relational databases have a single point of failure. When that database goes down, a failover to a backup system must happen and takes time.

# When NOT to use NoSQL?

### **When NOT to use a NoSQL Database?**

- **When you have a small dataset**: NoSQL databases were made for big datasets not small datasets and while it works it wasn’t created for that.
- **When you need ACID Transactions**: If you need a consistent database with ACID transactions, then most NoSQL databases will not be able to serve this need. NoSQL database are eventually consistent and do not provide ACID transactions. However, there are exceptions to it. Some non-relational databases like MongoDB can support ACID transactions.
- **When you need the ability to do JOINS across tables**: NoSQL does not allow the ability to do JOINS. This is not allowed as this will result in full table scans.
- **If you want to be able to do aggregations and analytics**
- **If you have changing business requirements** : Ad-hoc queries are possible but difficult as the data model was done to fix particular queries
- **If your queries are not available and you need the flexibility** : You need your queries in advance. If those are not available or you will need to be able to have flexibility on how you query your data you might need to stick with a relational database

### **Caveats to NoSQL and ACID Transactions**

There are some NoSQL databases that offer some form of ACID transaction. As of v4.0, MongoDB added multi-document ACID transactions within a single replica set. With their later version, v4.2, they have added multi-document ACID transactions in a sharded/partitioned deployment.

- Check out this documentation from MongoDB on **[multi-document ACID transactions](https://www.mongodb.com/collateral/mongodb-multi-document-acid-transactions)**
- Here is another link documenting **[MongoDB's ability to handle ACID transactions](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-multi-document-acid-transactions-general-availability)**

Another example of a NoSQL database supporting ACID transactions is MarkLogic.

# Types

- apache cassandra == partition row store
- MongoDB == document based
- DynamoKB == key, value based storage
- ApacheHBase == wide column store
- Neo4j == Graph database G = (V, E)

# Terminology

- keyspace == collection of tables
- table == a group of partitions
- rows == a single item

# Cassandra terminology

- Partition == a fundamental unit of access can refer to multiple columns
and a collection of rows
how data is distributed
- Primary Key == made up of a partition key and clustering columns
- Columns == clustering and data
labelled data

# Cassandra

- provides **SCALABILITY** and **HIGH AVAILABILITY** without compromising performance 
**FAULT TOLERANT**
- Uses it's own query language: CQL

### **Common Questions:**

**What type of companies use Apache Cassandra?**All kinds of companies. For example, Uber uses Apache Cassandra for their entire backend. Netflix uses Apache Cassandra to serve all their videos to customers. Good use cases for NoSQL (and more specifically Apache Cassandra) are :

1. Transaction logging (retail, health care)
2. Internet of Things (IoT)
3. Time series data
4. Any workload that is heavy on writes to the database (since Apache Cassandra is optimized for writes).

**Would Apache Cassandra be a hindrance for my analytics work? If yes, why?**Yes, if you are trying to do analysis, such as using `GROUP BY` statements. Since Apache Cassandra requires data modeling based on the query you want, you can't do ad-hoc queries. However you can add clustering columns into your data model and create new tables.
